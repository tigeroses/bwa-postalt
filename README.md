# Bwa-Postalt

Speed up bwa-postalt.js 

## Usage

### Build and run the standalone target

Use the following command to build and run the executable target.

```bash
cmake -Hstandalone -Bbuild/standalone
cmake --build build/standalone
./build/standalone/Postalt --help
```

### Build and run test suite

Use the following commands from the project's root directory to run the test suite.

```bash
cmake -Htest -Bbuild/test
cmake --build build/test
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 cmake --build build/test --target test

# or simply call the executable: 
./build/test/PostaltTests
```

To collect code coverage information, run CMake with the `-DENABLE_TEST_COVERAGE=1` option.

### Build the documentation

The documentation is automatically built and [published](https://thelartians.github.io/ModernCppStarter) whenever a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) is created.
To manually build documentation, call the following command.

```bash
cmake -Hdocumentation -Bbuild/doc
cmake --build build/doc --target GenerateDocs
# view the docs
open build/doc/doxygen/html/index.html
```

To build the documentation locally, you will need Doxygen, jinja2 and Pygments on installed your system.

### Build everything at once

The project also includes an `all` directory that allows building all targets at the same time.
This is useful during development, as it exposes all subprojects to your IDE and avoids redundant builds of the library.

```bash
cmake -Hall -Bbuild
cmake --build build

# run tests
./build/test/PostaltTests
# run standalone
./build/standalone/Postalt --help
# build docs
cmake --build build --target GenerateDocs
```
